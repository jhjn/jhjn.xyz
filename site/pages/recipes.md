### [Beef and Ale Stew](#topofpage)
**Ingredients**

* 2 sticks of celery
* 2 medium onions
* 2 carrots
* olive oil
* 3 fresh or dried bay leaves
* 500 g quality diced stewing beef
* 500 ml ale, Guinness or stout
* 1 heaped tablespoon plain flour
* 1x 400 g plum tomatoes

**Method**

1. If using the oven to cook the stew, preheat it to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.
1. Trim and roughly chop the celery, then peel and roughly chop the onions. Peel the carrots, slice lengthways and roughly chop.
1. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a casserole pan on a medium heat, add all the vegetables and the bay and fry for 10 minutes.
1. Add the beef and flour, then pour in the booze and tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon. Give it a good stir, then season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.
1. Bring to the boil, put the lid on and either simmer slowly on the hob or place in the oven for 3 hours, or until the meat falls apart easily. Remove the lid for the final half hour of simmering or cooking.

### [Stracotto](#topofpage)

**Ingredients**

* 1 kg piece of beef chuck , sinew removed
* olive oil
* 2 red onions
* 2 carrots
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 sticks of celery
* 1 bulb of fennel
* 1/2 a bunch of fresh rosemary, (15g)
* 1/2 a bunch of fresh sage, (15g)
* 250 ml Chianti red wine
* 2 tablespoons tomato purée
* 1.5 litres organic meat or veg stock

**Method**

1. Place the meat in a fairly snug-fitting casserole pan on a medium-low heat with 2 tablespoons of oil, turning with tongs, while you peel the onions, carrots and garlic, trim the celery and fennel, then roughly chop it all to make a soffritto – it cooks low and slow so there’s no need to be too precise. Stir into the pan, tie the rosemary and sage together and add, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes, or until starting to caramelize, stirring the veg and turning the meat occasionally.
1. Turn the heat up to high, pour in the wine, stir in the tomato purée, and let the wine cook away. Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then place a double layer of scrunched-up wet greaseproof paper on the surface. Reduce to a low heat and cook for around 3 hours, or until the meat is meltingly tender, turning and basting occasionally. Season to perfection.
1. Lift the meat out on to a board, carve it into thin slices, and spoon over enough of that incredible sauce to keep the meat nice and juicy. Toss the rest of the sauce (reduce on the hob, if needed) with freshly cooked tagliatelle, and finely grate over a little Parmesan, to serve.

1. Cook for 4 minutes, tossing regularly, then drizzle in the honey and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. Toss for 1 more minute until shiny and sticky.
1. Meanwhile, halve the pak choi, cook in a pan of boiling water for just 1 minute so they retain a bit of crunch, then drain well and plate up.

### [Korean-style Roast Chicken](#topofpage)

**Ingredients**

* 3 tablespoons of sesame seeds
* 250 g kimchi
* 2 tablespoons gochujang paste
* 2 tablespoons low-salt soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 1.4 kg whole free-range chicken
* 2 tablespoons runny honey

BUNS

* sesame oil
* 1 x 400 g tin of light coconut milk
* 2 coconut milk tins’ worth of self-raising flour, (500g), plus extra for dusting

SLAW

* 2 carrots
* 4 spring onions
* 2 fresh red chillies
* 1 bok choi
* 1/2 a Chinese cabbage
* 2 limes
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1/2 a teaspoon gochugaru, (Korean red pepper powder)

**Method**

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.
1. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and nutty.
1. Put the kimchi, gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds into a blender, and whiz until smooth.
1. Place the chicken in a snug-fitting baking tray. Pour one third of the marinade over the chicken and rub it in to all the nooks and crannies. Roast for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until everything is gnarly and cooked through.
1. Add the honey to the remaining marinade and blitz until combined. Pour half into a small bowl and set aside – this will be your dipping sauce. Keep the rest of the sauce for your glaze.
1. For the buns, cut out 12 x 8cm squares of greaseproof paper and rub each one with a little sesame oil to stop the buns sticking. Pour the coconut milk into a large mixing bowl, then add the flour and a good pinch of sea salt. Start mixing with a fork then get in there with your hands and knead until you have a soft, smooth dough – or do all this in a food processor.
1. Tip the dough onto a flour-dusted work surface and roll into a sausage shape. Quarter it, then cut each piece into three to make 12 even-sized pieces and roll each into a ball. One-by-one, with a rolling pin, roll the balls into 10cm x 12cm ovals. Lay an oiled chopstick across the middle like a hinge, fold the dough in half and pull the chopstick out. Place each bun on a little rectangle of greaseproof paper ready for steaming.
1. Remove the chicken from the oven and turn it off. Spoon over the reserved glaze to create another sticky layer and sprinkle over the remaining sesame seeds. Transfer to a plate and return to the oven to keep warm and tighten up the glaze while you cook the buns.
1. Working in batches, place the buns on their greaseproof squares into a large bamboo steamer and pop the lid on. Place the steamer over a large frying pan or wok filled with 300ml of boiling water and steam for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fluffy and cooked through.
1. For the slaw, scrub the carrots, trim the spring onions and chillies (deseed if you like), bok choi and cabbage. Finely zest and juice the limes into a serving bowl, add a little sesame oil and a good pinch of gochugaru. Finely chop all the slaw ingredients, drop them into the dressing bowl and toss with your hands to dress.
1. Shred the chicken and serve with the coconut buns, slaw and remaining sauce.


### [Crispy & Sticky Chicken Thighs with Squashed New Potatoes & Tomatoes](#topofpage)

**Ingredients**

* 800 g new potatoes
* 12 free-range chicken thighs, skin on, bone out
* olive oil
* 600 g ripe mixed-colour cherry tomatoes
* 1 bunch of fresh oregano, (30g)
* extra virgin olive oil
* red wine vinegar

**Method**

1. Scrub the potatoes and put into a large saucepan of salted boiling water and boil until cooked.
1. While the potatoes are cooking, preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.
1. Cut each chicken thigh into three strips and place in a bowl. Rub the meat all over with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, then toss.
1. Heat a large frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken pieces snugly in one layer, and put the chicken into the pan, skin side down. If you don’t have a pan that’s big enough, feel free to cook the chicken in two batches. Toss and fry over a low heat for 10 minutes, or until almost cooked, then remove with a slotted spoon to a large roasting tray or dish.
1. Prick the tomatoes with a sharp knife. Place them in a bowl, cover with boiling water and leave for a minute or so. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, pinch off their skins. You don’t have to, but by doing this they will become lovely and sweet when cooked, and their intense flavours will infuse the potatoes.
1. By now the potatoes will be cooked. Drain them in a colander, then lightly crush them by pushing down on them with your thumb.
1. Pick and bash up most of the oregano leaves with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, or a Flavour Shaker if you have one. Add 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, a good splash of red wine vinegar and some pepper and give everything another bash. Add to the chicken with the potatoes, the tomatoes and the rest of the oregano leaves. Toss everything together carefully.
1. Spread out in a single layer in the roasting tray, and bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until golden.
1. Lovely served with a rocket salad dressed with some lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, and a nice glass of white wine.

### [Jamie's Perfect Roast Chicken](#topofpage)

**Ingredients**

* 2 bunches of fresh soft herbs  such as basil, flat-leaf parsley, marjoram (60g)
* 1 lemon
* 4 fresh bay leaves
* 1 x 1.4 kg whole free-range chicken
* olive oil
* 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary


**Method**

1. Preheat the oven and a roasting tray to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7.
1. Pick and finely chop the soft herbs, halve the lemon and tear the bay leaves.
1. Rub inside the chicken cavity with sea salt, then carefully grab the skin at the tip of the chicken breasts, making sure that it doesn't rip, and pull up gently. With your other hand gently separate the skin from the meat of the breast – it's normally connected by a little bit of tissuey-type stuff, and you can either leave this attached in the middle and make two little tunnels either side or you can try to cut away the middle.
1. Sprinkle a little salt down the gaps that you have made, push in most of the chopped herbs and drizzle in a little oil.
1. Push the lemon halves into the cavity along with the bay and rosemary sprigs, then pull the skin of the chicken breast forward so that none of the flesh is exposed, tuck the little winglets under, and tie up as firmly as possible.
1. Rub a little oil all over the chicken skin, scatter over the remaining chopped herbs and season very generously with salt and black pepper. Slash each thigh about 3 or 4 times to allow the heat to penetrate directly.
1. Remove the hot tray from the oven and drizzle with a little oil. Put the chicken into the tray, breast-side down and leaning to one side, then place in the oven. Roast for 5 minutes, then lean it to the other side, still breast-side down. Cook for another 5 minutes, then place the chicken on its bottom and cook for 1 further hour, or until golden and cooked through – the skin should be really crispy and the herbs will flavour the meat– this really must be the best roast chicken.

### [Chicken Katsu Curry](#topofpage)

**Ingredients**

* 4 x 150g free-range skinless boneless chicken breasts
* 250 ml buttermilk
* 2 heaped teaspoons medium curry powder
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 120 g panko breadcrumbs
* 1 mug of basmati rice, (320g)
* 25 g creamed coconut
* 2 litres vegetable oil

SAUCE

* 1 onion
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger
* 1 medium carrot
* 1 bunch of fresh coriander, (30g)
* olive oil
* 1 teaspoon each garam masala, medium curry powder, turmeric
* 2 heaped tablespoons plain flour
* 1 heaped teaspoon mango chutney

PICKLE

* 1 red onion
* 1 lemon
* 1 fresh red chilli

**Method**

1. Press down firmly with the palm of your hand to slightly flatten each chicken breast. Place them in a bowl, pour over the buttermilk, add the curry powder and a pinch of sea salt, crush in the garlic, then toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.
1. When the time’s up, sprinkle the breadcrumbs on to a tray. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, shake off the excess, then turn in the breadcrumbs, pressing down to make them stick and flatten them a little more. Keep in the fridge until you’re ready to cook.
1. For the sauce, peel the onion, garlic, ginger and carrot, then finely chop with the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves).
1. Fry in a large pan on a medium low heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the spices for 15 minutes, or until starting to caramelize, stirring regularly.
1. Stir in the flour, then the mango chutney. Pour in 800ml of boiling water and leave to blip away for 15 minutes, or until reduced to a nice sauce consistency, stirring occasionally. Taste, season and add more mango chutney, if needed.
1. Meanwhile, place 1 mug of rice in a medium pan with 2 mugs of boiling water and a good pinch of salt. Break in the creamed coconut and mix together. Bring to the boil, stir, then put the lid on and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the water has evaporated. Turn the heat off and leave with the lid on.
1. Make a quick pickle by peeling and very finely slicing the red onion. Place in a bowl, finely grate in the lemon zest, squeeze in the juice and add a good pinch of salt. Deseed and finely slice the chilli and add to the bowl, then mix up.
1. Just under half fill a large sturdy pan with vegetable oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go.
1. Carefully lower the chicken into the oil, fry for 8 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, then drain on kitchen paper.
1. Alternatively, drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large, cold non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Cook the chicken for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning after 6 minutes and drizzling with an extra 2 tablespoons of oil as you turn.
1. To serve, put a quarter of the rice into a small bowl, press to compact and turn out on to a plate, then repeat with the other portions. Place the chicken next to the rice, cover with the sauce, then sprinkle over the pickle and the coriander leaves.

## Pork
### [Pork and Chive Dumplings](#topofpage)

**Ingredients**

DOUGH for 4 cups of filling

* 500 grams (4 cups / 18 ounces) all-purpose flour
* 265 milliliter (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons / 9 ounces) water

PORK FILLING

* 230 g Chinese chive
* 450 g ground pork
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* salt
* 1 tsp white pepper powder
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 stalk scallion
* 2 slice fresh ginger
* 2 tsp cornstarch
* 1 tbs vegetable cooking oil

Serve with ginger slices in chinese black vinegar.

**Method**

DOUGH

1. Add flour into a large bowl. Slowly pour the water into the bowl, mixing them together with a pair of chopsticks.
1. When the water is mixed with the flour, dust both hands with flour and start kneading to form dough. The dough will be quite tough and should easily be able to be lifted from the bowl without sticking to the bottom.
1. When dough has formed, dust the working surface with flour and dust hands again. Transfer the dough to the working surface and continue to knead it until its surface becomes smooth, about 10 minutes.
1. Rinse a clean dish towel with water. Dust the bottom of a large bowl with flour and transfer the dough into it. Cover bowl with the damp dish towel and a lid (or plastic wrap). Let the dough rest for 2 hours. You can let the dough rest longer, 4 to 5 hours.
1. After resting, the dough will be softened and have a smooth texture. Dust the working surface and your hands with extra flour and transfer the dough onto the surface. Knead the dough repeatedly for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the dough hardens again. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes (or longer).

FILLING

1. Start with the filling. Chop the Chinese chive into small pieces. About 1/8 inch long.
1. In a large bowl, combine the chopped chives with 1tsp of salt. Mix well and set aside for 20 minutes. This process will leave the chive to wilt, making it easier to mix later on.
1. In the meantime, chop the ginger and scallion then mix them with I cup of water. The ginger scallion water will be used in flavoring the meat filling.
1. Combine the wilted chive with pork, white pepper powder, soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and 1 tbsp of salt. Mix well using a soup spoon.
1. Slowly add ginger-scallion-water to the filling while swirling the spoon in one direction until you have a paste consistency. Add the sesame oil and vegetable oil and mix for one more minute. All this stirring and mixing will make the meat absorb the liquid you add to it, resulting a juicy stuffing. Set the filling aside.
1. Dust the working surface again and transfer the dough onto it. Slice 1/6 of the dough off and place the rest back to the big bowl. Cover it with the damp dish towel.
1. Roll the dough into a long stick, 2.5 to 3 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter. Use a knife to cut the dough stick into about 12 small doughs, each weighing 12 to 14 grams.
1. Slightly dust both sides of each small dough with flour. Work on them one at a time.
1. Dust the working surface again. Take one dough and press it to a round disc. Roll it with a rolling pin into a round sheet (refer to the video to see how). Try to roll it so that that the edge is thinner than the center. The wrapper should be about 1 millimeter thick (i.e. almost same as the thickness of a CD), and the diameter should be about 7 centimeters. It is ok if the wrapper is not perfectly round.
1. Starting here, you should work as quickly as you can, because the wrappers will dry out quickly. And if they do, you will find it very difficult to seal the dumplings later. If the wrappers dry out when you start to fold the dumplings, brush a bit of water over the edge so you can still seal the dough.
1. Scoop about 1 tablespoon (or less, so you can easily fold the dumpling) of dumpling filling and place it in the center of the wrapper. Hold the dumpling with one hand and start sealing the edges with the other hand (refer to the video to see how to fold a dumpling). Be careful, when you press the edges together to seal the dumpling, do not let filling touch the sealing area (the dumpling will fall apart if you do). After folding, press edge again to seal well.
1. Place the dumplings on the working surface and work on the rest of the doughs in the same manner.
Try to wrap and cook dumplings in small batches (20 to 25 dumplings at a time). If you won't cook dumplings soon after wrapping (within 30 minutes), freeze them first (refer to the session "to store dumpling" below).

BOIL

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
1. Carefully add dumplings one at a time into the water. Use a big ladle to stir the water gently and continuously, until the water starts to boil again, so the dumplings won’t stick to the bottom, for about 1 minute. Adjust the heat so the water is at boiling point, but isn’t bubbling too fiercely.
1. When the dumplings float to the surface, continue boiling until the dumplings are filled with air and swollen, and the dough starts to become transparent, about 1 minute (*see footnote 3). Immediately transfer all the dumplings to a plate.
1. When the dumplings are cooked, they will start to fall apart within seconds.

FRY

1. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. When oil is hot, place potstickers in the skillet, pleat side up.
1. Swirl 2 tablespoons water in the skillet, cover immediately, and turn the heat to medium. Cook covered until the water is evaporated and potstickers are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Remove the cover and flip one potsticker to see whether the bottom side is charred. If not, turn to medium high heat and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown.
1. Transfer the potstickers to a plate.
