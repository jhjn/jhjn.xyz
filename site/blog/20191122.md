### Four simple steps:

To run a website and own it completely yourself (not wordpress/hosted with github) we need to follow four simple steps.

* Rent a server to hold your webpages
* Run nginx to serve files to everyone
* Buy a domain to reach the site more easily
* Certify the site for http**s**
