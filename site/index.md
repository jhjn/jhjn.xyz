## What?

This is a personal website with links to [recipes](pages/recipes), "interesting" [links](pages/links), a [blog](blog) that hasn't been written and [more]()!

Soon there may be a [gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space) version of this site.

### Scripts

There are some scripts that I find useful that can be downloaded.

```
curl -sS http://ix.io/1Ryx > ix
curl -sS http://ix.io/1Ryw > somafm
curl -sS http://ix.io/1Ryz > brewsetup
curl -sS http://ix.io/2Awm > pp
```

## Why?

Be anti-centralisation, pro-federation.
