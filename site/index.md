This serves as a personal webpage with diversions to things that interest me, plus it was a self-hosting project. Decentralisation (*not facebook*) is important.

### Orwell

Ask yourself these questions:

1. What am I trying to say?
1. What words will express it?
1. What image or idiom will make it clearer?
1. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?
1. Could I put it more shortly?

And follow these rules:

1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
1. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
1. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
1. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.

From Orwell's essay "Politics and the English Language."
